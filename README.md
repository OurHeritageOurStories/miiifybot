# Miiifybot

## Discord chatbot for integration into Mozilla Hubs

This works builds on technology available in [Miiify](https://github.com/nationalarchives/miiify) to allow the community to interact with content displayed in a 3D virtual gallery. Users can learn about the content on display and also contribute back their knowledge. All contributions go through a review process before being accessible within the platform or within IIIF viewers.

## Example gallery

You try an example gallery of cats from Wikidata:

https://hubs.mozilla.com/dcRzw4T/general

The annotations are available in standard IIIF viewers:

https://projectmirador.org/embed/?iiif-content=https://miiifystore.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/iiif/manifest.json


The data is also accessible from the annotation server:


https://miiify.rocks/annotations/cats


You can even access the data directly in its GitHub repository:
