# Discord chatbot for integration into Mozilla Hubs

This works builds on technology available in [Miiify](https://github.com/nationalarchives/miiify) to allow the community to interact with content displayed in a 3D virtual gallery. Users can learn about the content on display and also contribute back their knowledge. All contributions go through a review process before being accessible within the platform or within standard IIIF viewers such as [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/).
